/**
 * A {@code Wrench} is a vector composed of 6 components with an angular part and a linear part. The
 * angular part represents a 3D torque and the linear part a 3D force.
 * <p>
 * The concept of a wrench is to describe an external spatial force, i.e. 3D torque and 3D force,
 * that is applied to a body. In this framework, the body on which the force is applied is referred
 * to using a reference frame commonly named {@code bodyFrame}. This reference frame is always
 * assumed to be rigidly attached to the body. As a result, a wrench is nothing more than a spatial
 * force to which a {@code bodyFrame} is associated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When using a {@code Wrench}, it is important to note that the reference frame in which it is
 * expressed does not only refer to the coordinate system in which the angular and linear 3D vectors
 * are expressed. The origin of the reference frame is also used as the point where the spatial
 * force is measured. Let's consider two reference frames A and B which axes are parallel but have
 * different origins, changing the frame of a spatial force vector from A to B will not affect the
 * linear part, i.e. the 3D force, but will still affect the value of the angular part, i.e. the 3D
 * moment. See {@link #changeFrame(ReferenceFrame)} for more information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The convention when using a wrench in matrix operations is that the angular part occupies the 3
 * first rows and the linear part the 3 last as follows:<br>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     / angularX \
 *     | angularY |
 *     | angularZ |
 * V = | linearX  |
 *     | linearY  |
 *     \ linearX  /
 * </pre>
 * </p>
