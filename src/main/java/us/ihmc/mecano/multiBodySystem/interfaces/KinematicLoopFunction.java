/**
 * A kinematic loop function represents the explicit formulation of the interdependency between the
 * joints composing a single kinematic loop.
 * <p>
 * The general formulation of such dependency can be written as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * q     = &Gamma;(y)
 * qDot  = G * yDot
 * qDDot = G * yDDot + g
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where:
 * <ul>
 * <li><tt>q</tt>, <tt>qDot</tt>, and <tt>qDDot</tt> are the configuration, velocity, and
 * acceleration vectors, respectively, for the kinematic loop joints.
 * <li><tt>y</tt> is a vector of independent variables providing sufficient information to fully
 * define the kinematic loop configuration. This can be a chosen subset of <tt>q</tt>.
 * <li><tt>yDot</tt> is a vector of independent variables providing sufficient information to fully
 * define the kinematic loop joint velocities. It is the first time derivative of <tt>y</tt>.
 * <li><tt>yDDot</tt> is a vector of independent variables providing sufficient information to fully
 * define the kinematic loop joint accelerations. It is the second time derivative of <tt>y</tt>.
 * <li><tt>&Gamma;(.)</tt> is the function that maps from <tt>y</tt> to the loop configuration space
 * <tt>q</tt>.
 * <li><tt>G</tt> is the linear transform from <tt>yDot</tt> the loop joint velocity space, this is
 * also referred to as the <b>loop Jacobian</b>.
 * <li><tt>g</tt> is a bias term when transforming from <tt>yDot</tt> the loop joint acceleration
 * space, this is also referred to as the <b>loop convective term</b>.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The framework is inspired from R. Featherstone's book on
 * <a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/files/70847609/download?download_frd=1">Rigid-Body
 * Dynamics Algorithms - Chapter 8: Closed Loop Systems</a>.
